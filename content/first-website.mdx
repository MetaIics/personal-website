So, this is kind of awkward.    
I never written a blog post before, but here's to the first. ðŸ¥‚



## introduction

For starters, I never really "created" a web-app before. 

Most of my web development experiences came from pre-existing set-ups or team-based projects, which never let me from learning the entire development pipeline! 
As summer arrived and my schedule cleared, I finally was able to experience the web development experience to it's fullest. 

Seeing how my peers used Next.js as the tech stack as well as other related dependencies, **I was ready**.



## type shit? more like TypeScript

Good news! I know what a JavaScript is.   
Bad news. Many template options Next.js displayed utilized TypeScript.  
Thankfully, it's not that different. 

I managed to find [a pretty template to use as my own website](https://magicui.design/docs/templates/portfolio)!  
This template utilized a completely different libraries, giving me the option to (god forbid) learn about new tech stacks.

The tech stack of the template (and this website) is as follows:  
React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Motion, and shadcn/ui.  

Of those six, I only know the first two. Fun.  
It was time for me to learn some new technologies!



## what the hell is a "tale win css"? 
Thankfully, a university degree in Computer Science wasn't all for naught.  

Generic pages generally utilized three components: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
What came to a surprise was the existence of Tailwind CSS, which simplified how certain parts of the page would look.  

...and my god, was it a god send.

One of the earliest examples was the lack of seperation of the "content" and the "background". Looking through the project, 
the background colors and how it was called can be found in the `globals.css` file. From there, simply adding the proper 
background color call i.e. `bg-muted` created a clean seperation of content.

Lastly, fixing the padding of the outer components created a nice "breathing space" between content within the center box and the background. 
To help fill in the empty space of the background, I found [a neat component from Magic UI](https://magicui.design/docs/components/animated-grid-pattern) to fill it in.

## oh my god the background took forever. why.
Unfortuantely, a university degree in Computer Science wasn't enough.  

In hindsight, the solution was basic and only needed a couple of Tailwind CSS class calls i.e. `-z-10` and `fixed`. However, researching how and why the grid pattern was 
constantly showing above the content as well as staying within an area of one-screen was insanely frustrating.

...thats really it. This section was really here just for me to vent about how I added the background, removed it cause it wasn't working, 
and re-added after when I figured it out. 



## imagine (dragons)

With the basics of the web page completed, all I needed is to set up a couple more things. For this version of the website:

- An artworks page to host a collection of my drawings.
- A blog page for additional updates or to yap about things.

Both should utilize the same styling for consistency, and should be found in the navigation bar at the bottom.
With how React works, the addition of these pages were simple. What's better, the template also provided a basic set-up
for the blog page!



## what the slug(ma)

With how the files are organized, the `app` folder with the `page.tsx` file is effectively the "Home" or root of the website.
You could imagine my surprise when I see a folder named `[slug]` within `app/blog`, which indicates that a webpage exists beyond `/` and `/blog`.

With my shallow research into [Dynamic Routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes), this is a simple way to easily add
(or remove) blog posts! The actual content of the blog is a `.mdx` file, which is then rendered as a webpage. Whenever I need to add a new blog post,
I can simply add another `.mdx` file.

Honestly one of the coolest things I've learned.



## ok, now for actual page formatting

Each of the artworks page, blog page, and individual blog page should have a way to return back to the home page. Using the same UI library (Magic UI),
I found a neat button that can redirect users to and from the home page. Along with adding a button to return back to the blog page within each post, the
website redirection is completed.

Along with minor edits to the `.mdx` to include a description and post type, the overall format of the pages feel complete.
There might be additional changes after this post is completed, but that's because I'm indecisive.

## moving forward

With everything customized to my liking, all I needed to do was add more customization and *flare* to the page.
This includes it's own `favicon.ico` icon, scroll progress at the top, and other images.

With that, I can then finally target my art gallery in another blog post later.

## see ya soon!
