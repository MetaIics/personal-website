So, this is kind of awkward.    
I never written a blog post before, but here's to the first. ðŸ¥‚



## introduction

For starters, I never really "created" a web-app before. 

Most of my web development experiences came from pre-existing set-ups or team-based projects, which never let me from learning the entire development pipeline! 
As summer arrived and my schedule cleared, I finally was able to experience the web development experience to it's fullest. 

Seeing how my peers used Next.js as the tech stack as well as other related dependencies, **I was ready**.



## type shit? more like TypeScript

Good news! I know what a JavaScript file is.   
Bad news. Many template options Next.js displayed utilized TypeScript.  

While a minor issue, the tech stack utilized in my classes cannot be any less similar. (See [UE5 Plug-in]() about the frontend stack). 
Thankfully, I had the option to (god forbid) learn about new tech stacks. With my lovely skill of typing at 30 WPM, I managed to find 
[a pretty template to use as my own website](https://magicui.design/docs/templates/portfolio)!

The tech stack of the template (and this website) is as follows:  
React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Motion, and shadcn/ui.  

Of those six, I only know the first two. Fun.  
It was time for me to learn some new technologies and libraries!


## what the hell is a "tale win css"? 
Thankfully, a university degree in Computer Science wasn't all for naught.  

Generic pages generally utilized three components: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
What came to a surprise was the existence of Tailwind CSS, which simplified how certain parts of the page would look.  

...and my god, was it a god send.

One of the earliest examples was the lack of seperation of the "content" and the "background". Looking through the project, 
the background colors and how it was called can be found in the `globals.css` file. From there, simply adding the proper 
background color call i.e. `bg-muted` created a clean seperation of content.

Lastly, fixing the padding of the outer components created a nice "breathing space" between content within the center box and the background. 
To help fill in the empty space of the background, I found [a neat component from Magic UI](https://magicui.design/docs/components/animated-grid-pattern) to fill it in.

## oh my god the background took forever. why.
Unfortuantely, a university degree in Computer Science wasn't enough.  

In hindsight, the solution was basic and only needed a couple of Tailwind CSS class calls i.e. `-z-10` and `fixed`. However, researching how and why the grid pattern was 
constantly showing above the content as well as staying within an area of one-screen was insanely frustrating.

...thats really it. This section was really here just for me to vent about how I added the background, removed it cause it wasn't working, and re-added after when I figured it out. 

```jsx
console.log("Hello World");
```
